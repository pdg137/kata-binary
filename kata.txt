UTF8 KATA

BACKGROUND:

- There are tens of thousands of characters in use around the world.

- Each character is assigned a number by the Unicode specification.

- To store a stream of characters, you need to convert to a BINARY
  format.

Utf-8 is a popular binary format for Unicode.
- ASCII 0-127: stored as 0xxxxxxx
- Characters 128-2047:   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
- Characters 2048-65535: 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
- etc.

GOAL: 

Parse a stream of bytes and return the corresponding Unicode
characters, as integers.

EXAMPLES:

ASCII: abcd
Two bytes: é
Three bytes: 你好
